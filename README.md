# Enlight Cohort Projects

# Chrome Extension Word Clipper
Google Chrome extension that saves the text you highlight with your cursor.

# Personal Dashboard 
Capstone project for Enlight Cohort (#1) is a personal dashboard for my personal convenience. Through this project I enhanced my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while also learning more about APIs and their functionality.

Visit my dashboard here: https://gho19.github.io/Personal-Dashboard/

For future iterations, I will consider making the dashboard responsive for mobile devices.

# Weather App
Following a YouTube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqZGuzrY9D4) I learned more about APIs and JS. This Weather App tells you the temperature of your current location in both Celcius and Farhenheit.

# Web Paint App
This Web Painiting application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allowing users to draw whatever they want using their trackpad! (Modifications from original source code include HEX color wheel and changing pen size with arrows)

For future iterations, I will add a mobile drawing option and fix the scrolling kinks.
